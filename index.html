      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How accurate is the AI?</h4>
        <p>
          Our AI is trained on a wide dataset of car images and can identify most common makes and models with impressive accuracy. 
          Rare or modified cars may sometimes be harder to classify, but we‚Äôre constantly improving with user feedback and fine-tuned training.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Is my data safe?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes. All personal and sensitive information is protected. Photos are processed to blur identifiable elements, 
          and you control what you share with the community. We never sell your data to third parties.
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do I need an internet connection?</h4>
        <p>
          TurboDex works best online, since it needs to access the latest car recognition models and our growing database. 
          However, basic recognition for popular cars can still work offline and sync later when you reconnect.
